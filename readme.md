# trigrams [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis] [![Coverage Status][codecov-badge]][codecov]

Trigrams for 400+ languages.

## Installation

[npm][npm-install]:

```bash
npm install trigrams
```

**trigrams** is also available as an AMD, CommonJS, and globals
module, [uncompressed and compressed][releases].

## Usage

```js
var trigrams = require('trigrams');

trigrams.all(); /* or `top`, or `min`. */
```

## API

### `trigrams.all()`

```js
trigrams.all().eng;
```

Yields:

```js
{
  'nou': 1,
  'n  ': 1,
  ' ai': 1,
  // ...
  ' an': 129,
  'the': 152,
  ' th': 154
}
```

Returns information about all trigrams occurring in a certain
declaration, in the form of an object.

Every attribute is the code used by [_UDHR in Unicode_][index].

Every value is the an object containing trigrams as its keys and
integers (occurrence counts) as its values.

### `trigrams.top()`

```js
trigrams.top().pam;
```

Yields:

```js
{
  'anm': 8,
  'obr': 8,
  'gpa': 8,
  // ...
  'ang': 374,
  'ing': 420,
  'ng ': 805
}
```

Same as `trigrams.all()`, but for every declaration object, returns
only the top 300 trigrams.

### `trigrams.min()`

```js
trigrams.min().nld;
```

Yields:

```js
[
  'als',
  'oon',
  'rdi',
  // ...
  'an ',
  'de ',
  'en '
]
```

A bit like `trigrams.top()`, but instead of a declaration object,
returns an array containing trigrams (without occurrence counts, as
its indice is the indicator).

## Supported trigrams

For a complete list of supported trigrams, see
[`supported-trigrams.md`][support].

## Data

The trigrams are based on the [Unicode][unicode] versions of the
[Universal Declaration of Human Rights][udhr].

The files are created from all paragraphs made available by
[`wooorm/udhr`][wooorm-udhr] and do not include headings and such.

## Cleaning

Before creating trigrams,

*   The unicode characters from `\u0021` to `\u0040` (both including)
    are removed;

*   One or more white space characters (`\s+`) are replaced with a
    single space;

*   Alphabetic characters are lower cased (`[A-Z]`).

Additionally, the input is padded with two spaces.
